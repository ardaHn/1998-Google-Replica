# 1998-Google-Replica
A quick project to re-create the first version of Google that was available back in 1988. This project contains both HTML & CSS.

# What I Learned
In this project I learned how to put my box-sizing, margin, and padding skills to use. I also had the chance to sharpen my skills of internet/solution searching. I used multiple boxes and forms.
